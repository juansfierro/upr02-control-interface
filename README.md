# UPR02 A200-Husky Control Interface
A PyQt6 application for teleoperation of the UPR02 Clearpath A200 Husky.

## Setup
- Install dependencies on Secondary Computer:
  - rosbridge_server
  - ffmpeg

- (Optional Recommenced) Copy the bash `.sh` scripts to /usr/local/bin/ directory.

- Set the script's directory in the `.service` files and move them to `/etc/systemd/system/` directory

- Enable and start the services
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start husky_camera.service
sudo systemctl enable husky_camera.service

sudo systemctl start rosbridge.service
sudo systemctl enable rosbridge.service
```

## How To Run
Install the required pip packages in `requirements.txt`.

Run `app.py`

## Connecting To The Robot Using Rosbridge
1. Enter the IP address and port of the Rosbridge server. By default, the Rosbridge server WebSocket is opened on port `9090`.
2. Press the "Connect" button and wait for confirmation that the connection was successful.
3. If the camera feed does not start automatically, press the "Restart" button and wait a few seconds for the live feed to start.

## Driving The Robot
Use the arrow keys to control the robot.
  - `Up` - Forward
  - `Down` - Backward
  - `Left` - Rotate left
  - `Right` - Rotate right
  - `Spacebar` - Stop

Note: This application was developed for the Clearpath A200 Husky, which uses a differential drive.

### Adjusting The Speed
Change the values for linear and angular velocity by a step interval:
  - `W` - Increase linear speed (m/s)
  - `S` - Decrease linear speed (m/s)
  - `Q` - Increase angular speed (rad/s)
  - `A` - Decrease angular speed (rad/s)

The interval size can be set between 0.01 and 1.00.

## Troubleshooting
1. Robot continues moving after disconnecting from Rosbridge server
   -  Verify that the clocks on the Husky's PC and SBC are synchronized and set to the current time. Verify, that your machine also has the current time. The Husky's PC and the secondary computer use Chrony to sync their clocks. To reconfigure the NTP, follow the steps in [Clearpath's documentation](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/networking/ntp/) and apply the changes.
2. Could not open UDP stream on port XXXX
   - If the camera stream does not start upon pressing the "Restart" button, verify that a camera is connected to the Secondary Computer and that it is transmitting video by checking the logs for the `husky_camera.service` service. If the camera is connected but not found, check it's path and replace it if need be. By default is should be `/dev/video0/`. Alternatively, check that the ports for the video stream in the application and the ports in `start_video_stream.sh` are matching and that neither computer is blocking them.
